My name is Ali Hannawi, and I’m part of the Detroit cohort at Per Scholas. My case study is a web application called Medilarm, 
built with Java, Maven and Springboot, as well as different front end and back end technologies. Medilarm, which obviously was built on the concepts learned in this program, 
mimics an alarm clock, but for medicine. So, like every common web app, it gives the user the ability to sign up, as well as log in and log out, and depending on 
whether they’re logged in, they can then set an alarm based on what kind of medicine they’re prescribed.

Through the power of various dependencies in Maven, I was able to communicate with a database and manipulate data in different ways. One of the concepts I learned in this
program, Spring Security, helped me emphasize whether a user is logged in or not in this project. Beyond that, there are various examples of the use of MVC, as well as several 
uses of different data structures and forms of object oriented programming concepts.
